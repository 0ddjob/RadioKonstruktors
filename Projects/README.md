## Project 5.1: Low Frequency Generator
The low frequency generator can be used to test low frequency amplifiers.<br>
The low-frequency generator consists of two stages. The first stage, assembled on transistor T1, is the generator itself, the generation frequency of which is determined by elements R1, R2, C1, C2, C3. The generated signal is amplified by transistor T2 and through resistor R8 enters the circuit under study.<br>
On the circuit board, assemble the low-frequency generator and amplifier according to the diagrams in Fig. 1-3, 1-1.<br>
After assembly, check the connections of the elements, their ratings according to the circuit diagrams. Turn on the power and hear sound vibrations in the speaker.<br>
